# Speech Recognition with AI

## Natural Language Processing With Convolutional Neural Networks

In this workshop we will see the basic workflow for creating a model that, based on a training dataset containing audio, predicts if a given sound is of one class (yes) or another (no).

With a set of training audio files containing labelled examples of both classes, the network will *learn* how to distinguish (in this case) two classes.
